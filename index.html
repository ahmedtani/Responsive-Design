      <p class="motivate">Monday: Get Motivated
Sure, even The Carpenters agreed that “Mondays always get you down,” but that doesn’t mean some good old-fashioned motivation can’t get you geared up and excited for the week ahead, even with all of its attendant challenges. Let these inspirational quotes, culled from many generations of brilliant thinkers, motivate you to go that extra mile today—especially if it doesn’t seem possible. It is possible, and we also suspect that the rest of your week will thank you later for the effort you put out today.</p>
